# Robotics 101: Computational Linear Algebra Solutions

This repository documents my journey through the **Robotics 101: Computational Linear Algebra** course offered by the University of Michigan Robotics Institute. This course is designed to show how mathematics and computation unify to reason about data and make discoveries about the world.

I am completing this course to strengthen my foundation in linear algebra and coding, both of which are essential for modern robotics and engineering.

## Course Overview
**Computational Linear Algebra** is a foundational course for first-year undergraduate students that blends mathematical theory and computational tools to solve real-world problems. The course content is built around:
- Systems of linear equations and their matrix representations.
- Numerical methods for matrix analysis.
- Applications in robotics and intelligent systems.

This repository will serve as a tracker for my solutions, notes, and progress.
